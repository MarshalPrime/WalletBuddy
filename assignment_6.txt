Assignment 6

Implementing security service to our service.

In this assignment, we established robust security measures to ensure controlled access and authentication for an API.
Here's a brief overview of the implemented features:

1. User Creation and Access Privileges:
   - Created a dedicated user in the database with restricted access privileges limited to read-only operations 
   (specifically `SELECT` statements).
   - Utilized this user to regulate access to certain API endpoints that retrieve data from the database, 
   ensuring that users can only read information without the ability to modify or delete.

   Mysql Code: create  user 'standard'@'localhost' identified with mysql_native_password  by 'StndrdPas#1';

               grant select on *.* TO 'standard'@'localhost' with grant option;

2. Integration of User Access for API Endpoints:
   - Integrated the newly created user credentials into the API endpoints that are responsible for fetching data from the database.
   - By associating these user credentials with the appropriate endpoints, ensured that only authorized users with read-only 
   permissions could access the data.

3. Implementation of Basic Authentication:
   - Employed the basic authentication method to fortify the security of the API.
   - This authentication mechanism requires users to provide their username and password for authorization before accessing the 
   API endpoints.
   - Implemented both on the backend and frontend to enforce strict access control and block any unauthorized attempts to interact 
   with the API.
   
   Authentication Used : Username: <username> password: <password>
